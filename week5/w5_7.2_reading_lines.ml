(*
read_lines is an **identifier** for a function that receives unit
that function is defined within a context in which sl exists (clousure!)
so everytime we call read_lines (), it uses the same ref (sl) to store the lines
sl is empty the first time only
*)

  in fun () -> aux ();;


(*
read_lines_fixed is a **function**
everytime we call it, a new context is created in which sl does not exist yet
so a new empty sl is created every time
*)
